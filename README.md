This repository contains accompanying material to the paper "A stable-set bound 
and maximal numbers of Nash equilibria in bimatrix games" by C. Ickstadt, 
T. Theobald and B. von Stengel, arXiv:2411.12385. It contains the SageMath 
programs which were used to produce the relevant stable-set data used in the 
paper, building on existing data of combinatorial types of polytopes.

The purpose of the SageMath code is to document the computer calculations 
which were used in the research for the paper. It was run under 
SageMath 9.2 and requires the data from M. Firsching as input,
with slight formatting changes as described in the file.
